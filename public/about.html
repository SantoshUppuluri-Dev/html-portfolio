<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Santosh Uppuluri, a developer passionate about creating intuitive and efficient solutions. I enjoy diving into code, whether it’s building web apps or exploring new frameworks. Constantly learning keeps me on my toes, and I love solving complex problems with elegant, scalable code.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I like to keep myself active—whether it’s going for a run, hitting the gym, or playing a round of tennis with friends. I’m also a big fan of reading, particularly tech blogs and fiction, to wind down and stay inspired.</p>

<p>My daily routine is pretty structured. I start my mornings with a quick workout, followed by some coding sessions. I love collaborating with others, so most of my afternoons are spent in brainstorming sessions or learning something new!</p>
